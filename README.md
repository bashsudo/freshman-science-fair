# freshman-science-fair

This repo holds the main documents for my poster and experiment in machine learning for my Freshman-year science fair project in 2019.

## Files Included

There are three main categories/folders of files that are included in this repo:

1. **posterboard_whole**: the posterboard reconstructed virtually as a whole.
2. **posterboard_printout**: the posterboard printout that was used to construct the original, physical presentation.
3. **research_docs**: the research document explaining the behavior of neural networks and recursive neural networks (RNNs); a simpler version is in the posterboard.

It is recommended to view the posterboard as a whole, as that includes nearly everything gathered and presented in the science fair (including everyting in the printout and the research docs).
